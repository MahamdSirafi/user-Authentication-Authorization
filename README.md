# Authentication, Authorization, Security, and Error Handling Project

## Introduction

This project aims to develop an application that manages authentication, licensing, protection, and error handling in Node.js. It includes the User table to manage user accounts.

## User Table

The User table stores information about the users of the system. It includes attributes such as user ID, username, email, password, role, and any additional user details.

## Authentication

The project implements authentication functionality to verify the identity of users. It includes features such as user registration, login, and logout. Authentication is implemented using techniques like password hashing and token-based authentication.

## Authorization

The licensing functionality allows the system to manage licenses for users or entities. It includes features such as license generation, validation, and expiration. The project may utilize license keys, digital signatures, or other mechanisms to enforce licensing rules.

## Security

The protection aspect focuses on securing the application and its resources. It involves implementing security measures such as user roles and permissions, access control, and data encryption. It aims to prevent unauthorized access, ensure data confidentiality, and protect against common security vulnerabilities.

### Explanation of Security Measures in the Code

The provided code snippet is a part of a web application written in JavaScript using the Express framework. The application includes several security measures to enhance the security and protection of the application. Here's an explanation of each measure:

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

The code uses the "cors" library to implement Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). CORS allows other websites to make requests to this web application. The allowed origins are specified, and the server responds with the appropriate "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header to indicate which origins are allowed to access the resources.

### Helmet

The "helmet" library is used to set secure HTTP headers. It helps protect the application from common web vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and MIME-sniffing attacks. Helmet automatically adds various security-related headers to the server's responses.

### Rate Limiting

The code utilizes the "express-rate-limit" library to implement rate limiting. It sets a maximum limit on the number of requests allowed from the same IP address within a specified time period. This prevents abuse and helps protect the server from DDoS attacks and brute-force attacks.

### Data Sanitization

To enhance security, the code uses the "express-mongo-sanitize" library for data sanitization. "express-mongo-sanitize" prevents NoSQL query injection by removing any characters that could alter the query's logic and structure. This helps protect the application from malicious queries and potential data breaches.

### XSS Protection

The "xss-clean" library is used for cross-site scripting (XSS) protection. It sanitizes user input by removing any malicious HTML tags and scripts. This prevents attackers from injecting harmful code into the application and protects users from potential XSS attacks.

### Parameter Pollution

The "hpp" library is employed to protect against parameter pollution attacks. It prevents parameter pollution by allowing only a specified set of parameters and rejecting duplicate parameters in the requests.

### Compression

The "compression" library is used to enable gzip compression of the server's responses. This reduces the size of the transferred data and improves the application's performance by reducing network latency.

## Error Handling

The project includes robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle and report errors. It implements error logging and provides informative error messages to aid in debugging and troubleshooting. The application may handle errors using try-catch blocks, error middleware, or error-handling frameworks.

## Database Seed

- create an admin user in the database

## Setting Up .env File

This guide explains how to set up an `.env` file to configure environment variables.

**Set up environment variables**:

    Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

Update all variables in the `.env` file with your own values:

## Database Seed

- create an admin user in the database by

```
$ npm run seed:dev
```


## Create document by hygen library

    ```bash

npm run generate:resource:document
```

## Add property in document by hygen library

    ```bash

npm run add:property:document
```

## Add property on object in document by hygen library

    ```bash

npm run add:property:objec
```

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment
- Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js
- Passport.js: Authentication middleware for Node.js
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Token-based authentication mechanism
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for data storage
